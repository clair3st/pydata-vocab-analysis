    "The motivation for $\\mbox{TF.IDF}$ is wanting to look at words that make documents stand out. These words are considered important for the document. If a word occurs in most documents, that may not be interesting to us. Similarly, if a word only occurs once in one document that is also not useful in summarizing our text. We want to see the words that occur often in a limited number of documents. This is why we are interested in the number of times a word occurs, and the number of documents it occurs in.\n",
